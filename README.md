# Flask User CRUD

### A simple example of RESTful services

## How to "install"

You may want to create a virtual environment and activate it via:

```
$> python3 -m venv venv
$> source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install all the dependencies like so:

`$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

(make sure you're in this directory when you run that, otherwise adjust accordingly).
